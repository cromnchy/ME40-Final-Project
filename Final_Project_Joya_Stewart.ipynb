To put this into perspective, 1 kg of refrigerant 134a,\nwhen leaked into the atmosphere, traps around the same amount of heat as 1430 kg of CO₂ would. That's equivalent to about 3500 miles of gas emissions from a standard motor vehicle.\n\nPhasing out synthetic refrigerants means replacing them with natural alternatives. Because these alternatives trap less heat by nature, designing an efficient cooling system with them requires careful application of engineering principles to optimize the cycle. One of the natural refrigerant alternatives is a CO₂-ammonia cascade system. In this project, we design this system to operate at -20°C in the East Bay. Through thermodynamic analysis, we will determine the optimum temperatures for CO₂ in the condenser and ammonia in the evaporator. We will also justify its use as an industrial meat freezer based on its operating temperature.","metadata":{}},{"id":"0e484ac0-1941-44f8-8d9f-e2d8c28e8acc","cell_type":"markdown","source":"-------\n\n## Background information\n\nA typical refrigeration cycle consists of four steps to remove heat from the internal environment and transfer it to the outside. Because most synthetic refrigerant alternatives are less effective at trapping heat, a \"cascade\" refrigeration cycle is used to cool the internal environment down to the operating temperature. In the cascade system, the low-temperature system removes heat from the space to be cooled using an evaporator and transfers it to a heat exchanger, which is cooled by the evaporation of the refrigerant from the high-temperature system. In the CO₂-ammonia system, CO₂ operates as the colder system and ammonia operates as the hotter system. This is because the evaporation temperature of CO₂ is lower than that of ammonia.\n\nTo find the optimum temperatures for CO₂ in the condenser and ammonia in the evaporator, we must consider the assumptions made in each of the eight steps of the cascade refrigeration cycle while taking into account our constraints:\n\n    Outside temperature in the East Bay: up to 32°C\n\n    Operating temperature of the internal environment: -20°C","metadata":{}},{"id":"84a3a063-9b44-4abe-bc2f-9d4d5aa1a293","cell_type":"markdown","source":"-------\n\n## Modeling the Thermodynamic Process\n\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"ca63d327-cac4-41ac-ab9a-a2da302926f4","cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n!pip3 install sympy\nimport sympy as sp\n!pip3 install CoolProp\nfrom CoolProp.CoolProp import PropsSI","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /srv/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages (1.8)\nRequirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /srv/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from sympy) (1.3.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: CoolProp in /srv/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages (6.6.0)\n"}],"execution_count":2},{"id":"ff4f1ad2-f6ab-4e69-9c22-bdff39dcee3c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"1-2: Adiabatic Stretching: The material is stretched which causes the temperature of the material to increase due to the work being done on it.
